# OSeMOSYS GNU MathProg - Storage test

This branch includes a modified version of OSeMOSYS and a simple model to test the storage functionality in OSeMOSYS.

And introductory presentation on how to model storage in OSeMOSYS is available at the RE-INTEGRATE Zenodo community: https://zenodo.org/records/13269708.

The modified version of OSeMOSYS used here differs from the master only in that it includes lines to print out table results for NetChargeWithinDay, in order to test how storage works.
