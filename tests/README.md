# GNU MathProg Tests

Here we provide a simple model to test the functionality of storage in the master version of OSeMOSYS.
Note that to test the functionality you need the version of OSeMOSYS from this branch, where we added lines to print out the variable NetChargeWithinDay.

The Reference Energy System represented by this simple model is illustrated in the figure below.
